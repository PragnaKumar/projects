# Course Projects
### Overiew
Hi! I'm Pragna Ravi Kumar, A Master's student at Wayne State University. This repo contains certain personal projects, course projects in collaboration with my friends/teammates. 
Have a look at it and let us know what improvements can be done or just feel free to use it as a foundational model to build much more complex projects.
Thank you!

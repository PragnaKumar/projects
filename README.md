# About Me
## Hi 👋, I'm Pragna Ravi Kumar

I’m a Master’s student at **Wayne State University**, pursuing an **MS in Artificial Intelligence**. I’m passionate about building intelligent, AI-driven systems that merge **machine learning**, **data processing**, and **automation** to solve real-world challenges.  

Throughout my journey, I’ve gained hands-on experience developing AI-powered solutions — both during my **internship** and through **course projects** in my master’s program. These experiences have helped me strengthen my skills in **computer vision**, **large language models (LLMs)**, **data analytics**, and **application deployment**.

## 💼 Internship Projects

Here are some of the projects I worked on during my internship 👇  

### 🧾 [Dataframe Time Analysis (Employee Duration Tracker)](https://github.com/PragnaKumar/dataframe-time-analysis)
**Overview:**  
Developed a **Streamlit-based application** that automates HR attendance tracking by calculating **Total In Duration** and **Total Out Duration** from Excel sheets.  
The app enables users to upload an Excel file, process the data, and download the updated file — simplifying manual analysis and improving accuracy.

### ⚙️ [P&ID Diagram Analysis](https://github.com/PragnaKumar/pid-diagram-analysis)
**Overview:**  
Built an **object detection and analysis system** using **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** to identify and interpret **Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs)** from images, videos, and live streams.  
Developed in **Streamlit**, the project demonstrates how deep learning can enhance **engineering workflows**, **component recognition**, and **diagram-based automation**.  
Currently under active development.

### 🔒 [Private GPT](https://github.com/PragnaKumar/private-gpt)
**Overview:**  
Implemented a **locally hosted GPT-based chatbot** that allows users to interact with documents **offline**, ensuring **data privacy** and **security**.  
Integrates **LangChain** and **Ollama** for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).  
For setup details, see the official [PrivateGPT Guide](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/tree/main/examples/langchain-python-rag-privategpt).

### 🏗️ [Steel Bar Analysis](https://github.com/PragnaKumar/steel-bar-analysis)
**Overview:**  
Designed a **computer vision tool** using **YOLO** to detect and segment **steel or iron rods** in videos and real-time streams.  
Built in **Streamlit**, it focuses on **industrial inspection**, **defect detection**, and **safety automation**.  
Still evolving — highlights the practical impact of AI in manufacturing and quality control.
